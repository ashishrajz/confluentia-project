This project is a full-stack web application that showcases the power of various AI models for content generation. ðŸš€ It enables users to create text, images, and videos from a unified interface by integrating multiple AI APIs. For image and video generation, the project leverages the Hugging Face API. Gemini is used for text generation, while OpenAI and Claude serve as helpful web development assistants for tasks like code generation and debugging. The application's modern and responsive design is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, with the UI/UX conceptualized in Figma. Authentication is securely handled by Clerk, and project data is stored in a MongoDB database.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
